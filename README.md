# GUI-based-Sorting-Visualizer-using-java
This Sorting Visualizer GUI project is a Java application that visually demonstrates sorting algorithms. Using Java Swing, users can input integers, choose from six algorithms(Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort), and observe the sorting process in real-time.
